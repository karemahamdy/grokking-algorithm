# what is the Algorithm:
algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes
some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as
output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the
input into the output.

For example, given the input sequence (31; 41; 59; 26; 41; 58), a sorting algorithm
returns as output the sequence (26; 31; 41; 41; 58; 59)

# `the keyword is: Efficiency`
 - time complexity 
 - and space in memory are taken
